The scene is inspired by a science-fiction horror movie called Cube. The mission of the player is to escape from the cube/room. 

### 1. Layout

If you click the big cube in the middle, the room will go red for a second, and the cube rotates itself. With those floating cube,  two light entities in the room (two animated rotating spheres) provides a weird atmosphere to the scene.

When the mouse(a hand icon in PC) hovering some clickable/unclickable objects, they might disappear or change colors/scale.

#### 3.1 Riddle Line1: Under the Ocean

On the ocean, a yellow cylinder flows up and down. When your mouse hovers over it, a prompt said: "See through Sea". Click it. You could see everything "under the ocean". The first line solved!

 Let's check the second line. It told you to "worship MOONLIGHT". Considering that the moonlight only exists at night, you probably need the night scene and a moon.  

#### 3.2  Riddle Line2: Worship the Moonlight

Let's find the mystery "under the ocean"! 

While investigating those cubes,  you find a cube changed its color to blue with a "Night is coming" prompt. It must be something important. Click it. The sky suddenly becomes dark.

You look around and see the moon swirling. You rush to it to see closer. It becomes larger when you mouse hovering above it.

There's no harm to click it, it won't explode. And a Portal with a text "Space" appears in the sky.

Let's go through the portal "Space"!

#### 3.3  Riddle Line3: Fight in the Space

Something is emitting out of the giant celestial object. An alien is approaching. What should you do? Stand still?

Again, there's no harm to click the alien, it won't kill you.

A quote of  Oscar Wilde shows up in the middle of nowhere:

​						 “We are all in the gutter, but *some of us are looking at the stars*.” 

Of course, this esoteric clue is not hard for you. 

Look up, nothing!

Look down, a Portal to another room!

Yes, you did it! Congrats!
